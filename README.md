# 42_philosophers
This is my solution for the philosophers project from 42 school.

## About the project
- It's a simulation for the well known "dining philosophers problem".
- Input will has to look like this:
>./philo {number_of_philosophers} {time_to die} {timeto_eat} {time_to_sleep} {number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional)}

## Rating
- I achieved 100/100 points.
